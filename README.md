# RSA Factoring Challenge

This project explores the basic concept of how RSA encryption works,
this challenge however is a simple task to write a programme that
computes a factor of a series of numbers feed into to the programme
in a form of a simple text file. A file containing a series of numbers
to be factorize. 

The output however will be printed on Standard Output, with the factor
of factorizing many numbers as fast as possible.
